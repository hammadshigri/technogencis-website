# Milestone M7 — Observability & Quality

- [ ] Configure Sentry for frontend and backend with source maps
- [ ] Add request logging and tracing in FastAPI (e.g., structlog / OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Implement security headers, CORS, and rate limiting on backend
- [ ] Add route-level error boundaries (`error.tsx`) and friendly fallbacks
- [ ] Configure performance budgets and monitor Web Vitals on Vercel
- [ ] Alerts/dashboards for error rates and latency (Sentry/host)
- [ ] Worker/queue monitoring: job throughput, failures, retries, DLQ visibility
- [ ] Redis health checks/metrics; connection pool monitoring
- [ ] Correlate logs between FastAPI → worker → Supabase events (trace IDs)
